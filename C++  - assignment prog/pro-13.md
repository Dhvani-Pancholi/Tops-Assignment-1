| Implicit | Explicit |
| -------- | ---------- |
| Initiated By Compiler | Initiated By Programmer
| No specific syntax needed | Requires casting syntax
| Automatic and limited control | Full control over the conversion
| Generally safe (type promotion)  |Can lead to data loss or precision issues|
| Simple, logical conversions | Complex or unsafe conversions |

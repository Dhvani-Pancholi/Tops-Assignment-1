<h4>What are conditional statements in C++? Explain the if-else and switch statements</h4>

 C++ supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:

- Less than or equal to: a <= b
- Less than: a < b
- Greater than or equal to: a >= b
- Greater than: a > b
- Not Equal to: a != b
- Equal to a == b


<b> if-else : </b>

- Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true

- Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false

- Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false

<b> Switch-case : </b>
- Use switch to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed

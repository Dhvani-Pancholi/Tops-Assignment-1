// What is the difference between OOP and POP?

OOP:

OOP treats data as a critical element in the program development and does not allow it to flow freely around the system.
In OOP, the major emphasis is on data rather than procedure (function).
An object-oriented program uses the bottom-up approach.

POP:

In the procedure oriented approach, large programs are divided into smaller programs known as functions.
In POP, a program is written as a sequence of procedures or function.
POP uses the top-down approach.

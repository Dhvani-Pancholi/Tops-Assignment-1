<h4>Explain the key concept of Oop </h4>

<b>1. Classes and Objects</b>
- Class: A blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines data members (attributes) and member functions (methods).

- Object: An instance of a class or you can say Any entity that has state and behavior is known as an object. For example: chair, pen, table etc. It can be physical and logical

<b>2. Encapsulation</b>

- Encapsulation is the bundling of data and methods that operate on that data into a single unit (class).

Access to data is controlled using access specifiers:

- public: Accessible from anywhere.
- private: Accessible only within the class.
- protected: Accessible within the class and derived classes.

<b> 3. Inheritance</b>

- Inheritance allows a class (derived class) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (base class), promoting code reuse.

Types of inheritance in C++:

- Single inheritance
- Multiple inheritance
- Multilevel inheritance
- Hierarchical inheritance
- Hybrid inheritance


<b> 4. Polymorphism</b>

- Polymorphism means "many forms" and allows methods to behave differently based on the object that invokes them.

Types of Polymorphism in C++:

1. Compile-Time Polymorphism (Static Binding):

- Achieved using function overloading or operator overloading.
- Resolved at compile time.

2. Run-Time Polymorphism (Dynamic Binding):

- Achieved using virtual functions and function overriding.
- Resolved at runtime.

<b>5. Abstraction</b>

- Abstraction hides the implementation details and shows only the essential features of an object.
In C++, abstraction is achieved through:

- Abstract Classes: Classes that contain at least one pure virtual function.

<h4>What is encapsulation in C++? How is it achieved in classes?</h4>

<b>Encapsulation in C++</b>

- Encapsulation is one of the core principles of Object-Oriented Programming. It refers to the bundling of data (variables) and functions (methods) that operate on the data into a single unit, called a class. 

- It also involves restricting direct access to some of the object's components, which is achieved through access specifiers.

<b>How Encapsulation is Achieved in C++ Classes</b>

In C++, encapsulation is implemented through access specifiers and class members. A class typically contains:

1. Private members: These are accessible only within the class. They are used to hide implementation details.

2. Public members: These are accessible from outside the class and are used to interact with the object.

3. Protected members: These are accessible within the class and by derived classes (used in inheritance).

#### What is the purpose of specifying data types and constraints during table creation?

###### The purpose of data type and constraints :

- Maintaining data integrity SQL constraints ensure that the data stored in a database is accurate and consistent by enforcing rules that prevent invalid or inconsistent data from being entered.

- Avoiding errors By preventing invalid or inconsistent data from being entered, SQL constraints help avoid errors that can arise from incorrect data.

- Improving performance By enforcing data rules at the database level, SQL constraints can help improve the performance of database queries and reduce the risk of application crashes.

- Enforcing restrictions on the type of data that goes into a database table to protect it from malicious attacks and ensure consistent data.

- Maintaining data accuracy and integrity by limiting the types of data that can be inserted into a table.
